## About Me
For over eight years, I've dedicated myself to developing AI-centric products and services, building a robust skill set in software engineering, project management, team leadership, and data science. My journey into AI began 15 years ago during university when I was developing robots and encountered the limitations of control systems at that time. The desire to make robots smarter and more capable sparked my passion for artificial intelligence that continues to drive me today.

As a freelance consultant alongside my primary role, I specialize in cutting-edge AI implementations including:
- Planning systems powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Content recommendation systems that extract user preferences using advanced embedding models
- Real-time voice conversation systems leveraging LLMs with RAG for domain-specific expertise

What sets me apart is my commitment to ultra-rapid PDCA cycles through agile methodologies—whether I'm working on embedded systems or LLM-based proof-of-concept products. I believe in moving fast, learning quickly, and delivering tangible value at every iteration.

Looking ahead, my vision is to lead product development that genuinely solves user pain points. I'm passionate about issue-driven problem solving and creating technology that makes a meaningful social impact. Beyond technical work, I'm fascinated by organizational development concepts like Holacracy and Teal organizations, though I'm still exploring these areas of team building methodologies.

[On this website](../blog), I write blog posts primarily in Japanese about natural language processing, machine learning, and software engineering.

## Work Experience


### AI Consultant, Research Engineer
**Freelancer**  
Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan  
February 2023 - Present 

I collaborate with companies to implement a wide range of AI solutions, including cutting-edge recommendation systems, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) powered by large language models, and sophisticated speech-driven conversational systems. I provide comprehensive development and consulting services to help organizations seamlessly integrate these technologies into their products and workflows.

### Embedded AI Engineer
**Sony Corporation**  
Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan  
April 2022 - Present 

I currently develop advanced subject-recognition AI for autofocus in mirrorless digital cameras, enabling photographers to capture images effortlessly without typical focusing concerns. Beyond my core software engineering responsibilities, I optimize system performance through field testing and in-depth interviews with industry professionals. My recent work has expanded to include developing object tracking algorithms and creating hardware drivers for recognition autofocus AI, ensuring our technology remains robust and cutting-edge.

Products I have been involved in: [α7RV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgjM20oDLSo), [α9III](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gCKcq4THNQ), [α1II](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYMNPvgWcdY)

### Machine Learning Engineer, Data Scientist
**So-net Media Networks Co.,Ltd.**  
Shinagawa-Ward, Tokyo, Japan  
October 2018 - June 2022  

As a senior machine learning engineer and data scientist, I led the end-to-end development and operation of AI-driven user targeting products for digital advertising. By building real-time user targeting systems and ensuring continuous, stable operations, I delivered significant revenue growth and improved key performance metrics.

### Software Engineer
**Sony Imaging Products & Solutions Inc.**  
Atsugi, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan  
April 2017 - September 2018  

I contributed to developing an "AV over IP" solution built around CLED, a state-of-the-art large-scale LED display technology.

### Data Scientist, Analyst (Part-time Job)
**National Maritime Research Institute (国立研究開発法人 海上技術安全研究所)**  
Mitaka, Tokyo, Japan  
November 2014 - March 2017  

I analyzed ship operation monitoring data to evaluate and estimate vessel propulsion performance. I also authored research papers documenting my analytical methods and findings.
